* Problem:
With the current configuration, if we need to remove web1 from the list, 
	web1 server is renamed to web2, web2 -> web3, web3 is to be destroyed. 

* Task: 
Given {main.tf, variables.tf, terraform.tf}, update the configuration so that if we need to remove "web1" server, 
	only that resource is destroyed, and the remaining 2 remain unchanged. 

* Specifications:
	+ Terraform version: 1.13.1.
	+ AWS version: 6.12.0+.
	+ Provide value for AMI by first getting it by using Get-Ohio-Ubuntu-AMI module.
